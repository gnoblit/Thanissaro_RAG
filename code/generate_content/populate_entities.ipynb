    "SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = \"\"\"You are an expert data extractor specializing in Buddhist philosophy and the Pali Canon. Your primary function is to analyze a Sutta text and extract a knowledge graph based **exclusively** on the information contained within that text. You will identify the internal ontology—the entities, processes, relationships, and concepts—as they are defined and related *within the Sutta itself*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output will be used to generate a knowledge graph for Graph RAG, so precision, adherence to the text, and correct formatting are paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Text-Only Extraction:** All extracted information **must** be directly present in or clearly implied by the provided Sutta text. Do not introduce any external Buddhist knowledge, interpretations, or definitions.\n",
    "2.  **Internal Ontology:** Focus on how the Sutta defines its own terms and relationships. Pay close attention to metaphors, where one concept is defined in relation to another.\n",
    "3.  **Graph-Ready Relationships:** Every relationship must be a \"triple\" with a single, specific source and a single, specific target.\n",
    "4.  **Relevance Filter:** Extract only entities, processes, and relationships that are thematically significant to the Sutta's core message and its practical teachings. Ignore incidental details (e.g., \"a monk sat down\").\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Sutta text provided below, perform the following extraction steps and format the output as a single Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Identify Entities**\n",
    "Extract significant nouns or concepts that function as \"things\" in the Sutta. An entity can be a being, an abstract concept treated as an object, a mental state, or a place.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`name`**: The name of the entity.\n",
    "*   **`type`**: [+] A broad category. Use the following **non-exhaustive list as a guide** to inform your judgment: 'Person', 'Group', 'Mental State', 'Concept as Object', 'Location', 'Physical Object', 'Figurative Language'.\n",
    "*   **`description`**: A summary of the entity based *only* on its description in this text. If not described, state \"Not described in this text.\"\n",
    "*   **`goal`**: Any stated goal of the entity.\n",
    "*   **`intention`**: Any stated intention of the entity.\n",
    "*   **`practice_link`**: How this entity relates to a Buddhist practice, if mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Identify Processes**\n",
    "Extract significant actions, events, or transformations. A process describes something happening over time and typically involves one or more entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`name`**: A concise name for the process (e.g., 'The Arising of Suffering', 'Cultivating the Path').\n",
    "*   **`description`**: A high-level explanation of the process as described in the text.\n",
    "*   **`impacted_entities`**: A list of entity names impacted by this process.\n",
    "*   **`steps`**: Deconstruct the process into a sequence of events.\n",
    "    *   **`step_description`**: Description of the step.\n",
    "    *   **`starting_state`**: The state or entity before the action.\n",
    "    *   **`action`**: The action being performed.\n",
    "    *   **`resulting_state`**: The state or entity after the action.\n",
    "*   **`goal`**: The stated or implied goal of the process.\n",
    "*   **`practice_link`**: How this process relates to a Buddhist practice, if mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Identify Relationships**\n",
    "Extract directed connections between entities and/or processes. These are the edges of your knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "[+] **Guiding Principles for Relationship Labels:** Before extracting, understand these principles for creating the `relationship_label`.\n",
    "*   **Be Active & Simple:** Formulate the label as a concise, active verb phrase, standardized to its base form (e.g., use `LEADS_TO` instead of \"leads to\" or \"led to\").\n",
    "*   **Capture the Nuance:** The label should be as specific as the text allows. Instead of a generic `RELATES_TO`, prefer `IS_A_CAUSE_OF`, `IS_A_COMPONENT_OF`, `IS_COMPARED_TO`, or `IS_AN_ANTIDOTE_FOR`.\n",
    "*   **Common Relation Types to Look For (Non-Exhaustive List):**\n",
    "    *   **Causal:** `CAUSES`, `LEADS_TO`, `IS_A_CONDITION_FOR`, `RESULTS_FROM`\n",
    "    *   **Compositional:** `IS_PART_OF`, `CONSISTS_OF`, `IS_AN_EXAMPLE_OF`\n",
    "    *   **Social/Narrative:** `INTERACTS_WITH`, `ASKS_QUESTION_OF`, `TEACHES`, `RESIDES_IN`\n",
    "    *   **Comparative:** `IS_COMPARED_TO`, `IS_SUPERIOR_TO`, `IS_OPPOSITE_OF`\n",
    "    *   **Definitional:** `IS_DEFINED_AS`, `IS_A_TYPE_OF`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, extract the relationships with the following attributes:\n",
    "*   **`source`**: The name of the source Entity or Process.\n",
    "*   **`target`**: The name of the target Entity or Process.\n",
    "*   **`relationship_label`**: A short, general, verb-based label for the relationship, following the principles above (e.g., 'LEADS_TO', 'IS_A', 'CAUSES'). This will be the predicate in your graph triple.\n",
    "*   **`specific_description`**: A detailed sentence describing how the text *specifically* frames this relationship. Capture the unique context and nuance.\n",
    "*   **`medium`**: The entity or process that enables or facilitates the relationship, if specified.\n",
    "*   **`outcome`**: The result of the relationship, if different from the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Identify Concepts**\n",
    "Extract key doctrinal or philosophical ideas being explained. A concept is a teaching or a principle, whereas an entity is treated as a \"thing\" within the Sutta's narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`name`**: The name of the concept (e.g., 'The Four Noble Truths', 'Impermanence').\n",
    "*   **`description`**: An explanation of the concept based *only* on how it is presented in this Sutta.\n",
    "*   **`practice_link`**: How this concept is connected to a specific practice.\n",
    "*   **`goal`**: The goal or purpose associated with understanding this concept.\n",

    "You are an expert in Buddhist philosophy and the Pali Canon. Your task is to analyze the provided Sutta text and extract its key elements, focusing on the ontology of entities, processes, and relationships described within the text itself. Provide the information in a structured format. You are helping me to generate a knowledge graph for Graph RAG and document interaction for the Pali Canon. The Pali Canon is a set of suttas that are related to Buddhism. Importantly, the Buddha and his monks often spoke in metaphor. This means that entities in the Canon exist that are defined relative to other entities. There is effectively an ontology, a set of entities and processes as well as the relationships among them, that is defined within the Pali Canon itself. It is your job to help identify these entities, processes, and relationships. You should focus on extracting relationships that exist in the current Sutta. Do not include any external information in the extraction. You should focus on only extracting graph-ready information in which each relationship should have only a single source and target.\n",

    "4.  **Extract Relationships:** Identify key and important relationships between entities and processes in the Sutta. For each, give a relationship name, a description from the Sutta, the source, the target, and a relationship type (e.g., causal, associative, constituent, etc.).\n",
    "5.  **Extract Concepts:** Identify key Buddhist concepts. For each, give its name, a description based on the Sutta.\n",

This means I think of the ontology as a sort of graph of nodes (entities) and connections between nodes (relationships). I call this an ontology because \"meaning\" of something in such a system can be explained in terms of other entities and relationships. This is how things are often explained in the Pali Canon, so it seems to fit. But if you think I am missing some element, please fill it in. \n",

      "Here's a breakdown of the thinking process to arrive at the ontology for the given sutta:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to extract an ontology (entities and relationships) from a single Buddhist sutta. The ultimate aim is to understand Buddhist concepts related to human experience and psychology. The output should be a Python dictionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Identify Core Entities:** The sutta explicitly mentions three \"persons\" as the central entities. These categories of persons form the primary structure. So, the initial entities are:\n",
      "    * Person (general category)\n",
      "    * Easy to Measure Person\n",
      "    * Hard to Measure Person\n",
      "    * Immeasurable Person\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Analyze Each Entity Type:** Go through the descriptions of each person type and identify their defining characteristics. These characteristics will become attributes of the entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Easy to Measure Person:**  The description focuses on negative qualities of mind and behavior. These translate into attributes:\n",
      "        * High-strung\n",
      "        * Rowdy\n",
      "        * Unruly\n",
      "        * Talkative\n",
      "        * Loose Words (consider grouping related concepts)\n",
      "        * Muddled Mindfulness\n",
      "        * Unalert\n",
      "        * Unconcentrated\n",
      "        * Scattered Mind\n",
      "        * Faculties Left Wide Open (consider this related to lack of control)\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Hard to Measure Person:** This is essentially the opposite of the \"easy to measure\" person, with positive qualities.\n",
      "        * Not High-strung\n",
      "        * Not Rowdy\n",
      "        * Not Unruly\n",
      "        * Not Talkative\n",
      "        * Not Loose Words\n",
      "        * Established Mindfulness\n",
      "        * Alert\n",
      "        * Concentrated\n",
      "        * Mind Gathered into Singleness\n",
      "        * Restrained Faculties\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Immeasurable Person:** This is defined by the attainment of Arahantship.\n",
      "        * Arahant\n",
      "        * Effluents Ended (This is a key Buddhist concept that needs its own entry)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Identify Relationships:** Look for verbs or phrases that connect the entities and their attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "    * The descriptions *are* the relationship between the person type and their characteristics. This can be represented as a \"has_characteristic\" relationship.\n",
      "    * The \"is a\" relationship connects the specific person types to the general \"Person\" category.\n",
      "    * The \"Immeasurable Person\" is explicitly defined as a \"monk\" who is an \"arahant.\" This implies an \"is_a\" relationship with \"Monk\" and \"has_attainment\" relationship with \"Arahant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Refine and Structure:** Organize the identified entities and relationships into the requested Python dictionary format. Think about how to represent the relationships clearly. Using lists of related entities within each entity's dictionary seems like a good approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Consider Additional Concepts:**  As the user requested, think about if there are missing elements. The concept of \"Effluents\" is crucial in Buddhism and directly tied to the \"Immeasurable Person.\" It needs to be included as an entity.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Address the User's Goals:** Reflect on how the extracted ontology helps the user understand the Buddhist perspective on human experience. The descriptions highlight different states of mind and behavior, which are central to Buddhist teachings on the path to liberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Review and Iterate:**  Read through the generated dictionary and the sutta again to ensure accuracy and completeness. Are there any other implicit relationships or entities? For instance, the concept of \"measurement\" is central, but it's more of a framing device than a core entity within the individuals themselves. The focus is on the *qualities* that make them measurable or immeasurable.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Format the Output:** Ensure the Python dictionary is correctly formatted and easy to understand. Use clear and descriptive keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "This step-by-step process, focusing on identifying entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them, allows for a systematic extraction of the ontology from the given text. The iterative review helps catch any missed concepts and ensures the output meets the user's stated goals.\n",

      "**Explanation and Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This dictionary represents a preliminary ontology extracted from the provided sutta. Here's a breakdown of the choices made and how they relate to your goals:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Entities:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Person:**  A fundamental entity representing the individuals being discussed. We identify different types of people.\n",
      "* **Easy to Measure Person, Hard to Measure Person, Immeasurable Person:** These are the core categories defined in the sutta. Their descriptions are directly derived from the text.\n",
      "* **Monk:**  Specifically mentioned in the context of the \"Immeasurable Person,\" indicating a role or status.\n",
      "* **Effluents:**  A crucial Buddhist concept directly linked to the definition of an Arahant. It's important to include this as it's central to the \"immeasurability.\"\n",
      "* **Mindfulness, Concentration, Faculties:** These are mental qualities or capacities discussed in the descriptions of the different person types. Treating them as entities allows us to explore their attributes and relationships.\n",
      "* **Arahantship:** The state of being an Arahant, representing the culmination of spiritual practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Relationships:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **`has_type` and `is_a_type_of`:** These establish the hierarchical relationship between the general \"Person\" and the specific types.\n",
      "* **`is_a`:**  Used for direct identity or membership, like an \"Immeasurable Person\" *is a* \"Monk.\"\n",
      "* **`has_attribute`:** Links the person types to their defining characteristics. While not explicitly listed as \"has_attribute\" in the dictionary's entities section, the `attributes` lists implicitly represent this relationship. You could further refine this by adding `has_attribute` relationships in the \"relationships\" section and linking attributes as entities if needed for more granularity.\n",
      "* **`has_state`:**  Specifically used for \"Effluents Ended,\" as this describes a condition of the \"Immeasurable Person.\"\n",
      "* **`can_be_type`:** Indicates a potential category membership.\n",
      "* **`state_of`:** Connects \"Effluents\" to the \"Immeasurable Person.\"\n",
      "* **`can_be_qualified_by`:**  Used for descriptors of \"Mindfulness\" and \"Concentration.\"\n",
      "* **`part_of`:** Indicates a component relationship, like \"Faculties\" being part of a \"Person.\"\n",
      "* **`attained_by`:** Connects \"Arahantship\" to the \"Immeasurable Person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**How this addresses your goals:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Identifying Entities and Relationships:** The dictionary explicitly lists entities and the relationships between them, forming the basis of your desired graph structure.\n",
      "* **Understanding Buddhist Ontology:** The extracted entities and relationships represent key concepts within this specific sutta and broader Buddhist thought. You can start to see how different mental states and levels of spiritual development are categorized.\n",
      "* **Metaphor and Meaning:** By identifying the attributes and relationships, you can begin to understand the *meaning* behind the descriptions. For example, \"muddled mindfulness\" is contrasted with \"established mindfulness,\" pointing to a desired mental state in Buddhist practice. The \"immeasurability\" of the Arahant is directly tied to the \"ending of effluents,\" highlighting the transformative effect of spiritual practice.\n",
      "* **Graph Structure for RAG:** The dictionary format can be easily transformed into a graph database (e.g., using libraries like `networkx` in Python) where entities are nodes and relationships are edges. This graph can then be used for RAG, where you can retrieve relevant information based on the connections between concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential Improvements and Considerations for Future Suttas:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Granularity of Attributes:**  You might decide to treat some attributes as entities themselves if they are complex concepts. For example, \"muddled mindfulness\" could become an entity with its own attributes.\n",
      "* **Implicit Relationships:**  The sutta implies a progression or a goal in moving from the \"Easy to Measure\" to the \"Hard to Measure\" and ultimately the \"Immeasurable.\" You might consider adding relationships like \"potential_for\" or \"path_to.\"\n",
      "* **Contextual Information:**  Consider adding the sutta name or reference as metadata to the ontology.\n",
      "* **Overlapping Concepts:** As you process more suttas, you'll encounter overlapping concepts. You'll need a strategy for merging or linking these concepts in your overall ontology.\n",
      "* **Nuance and Interpretation:**  Remember that language, especially in ancient texts, can have multiple layers of meaning. Your ontology will be an interpretation based on the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "This initial ontology provides a solid foundation for your exploration of Buddhist concepts. As you process more suttas, your understanding of the underlying ontology will become richer and more nuanced.\n",
