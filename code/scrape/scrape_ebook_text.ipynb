On the uposatha day, they enjoin their disciples thus: ‘Come, good man, having laid aside all clothes, recite: ‘I am not anywhere the belonging of anyone, nor is there anywhere anything in any place that is mine.’<sup><a href=\"../xhtml/notes.html#afn_476\" id=\"bfn_476\">476</a></sup> However, his parents know: ‘This is our son.’ And he knows: ‘These are my parents.’ His wife and children know: ‘He is our supporter.’ And he knows: ‘These are my wife and children.’ His slaves, workers, and servants know: ‘He is our master.’ And he knows: ‘These are my slaves, workers, and servants.’ Thus on an occasion when they should be enjoined in truthfulness, [the Nigaṇṭhas] enjoin them in false speech. This, I say, is false speech. When that night has passed, he makes use of possessions that have not been given. This, I say, is taking what has not been given. It is in such a way that the Nigaṇṭhas’ uposatha is observed. When one has observed the uposatha in the way of the Nigaṇṭhas, the uposatha is not of great fruit and benefit, nor is it extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive.</p>&#13;\n",
